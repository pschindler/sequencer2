* Missing features - Important:

- More than 7 transitions
- Simultanious RF pulses

* Missing features - Not that important

- Change sequence list to custom dict
- Add an interactive include tester
- Logging to files
- DDS sweeps
- Shape handling in the DDS RAM.
- Error handling
- Stack for subroutines (in VHDL ???)
- QFP variable type handling (bool, int)

* Missing unitttests

- DIO confiuration
- Line Trigger
- Cycle Count
- Trigger for QFP
- Configuration for PCP internals
- DDS switching off
- Conflict handling
- Pulse Shaping

* Missing tests on hardware

- QFP Variable handling
- Amplitude calibration
- Amplitude calibration for shapes
- finite loops (bdec,ldc)
- Inverted TTLs
- TTL subsystem
- Additional label/subroutine/loop testing
- Additional tests for the LVDS Bus
- Wait insn
- phase coherent switching
- High level functions for the DAC,DDS


* Description of missing features


- More than 7 transitions:

At the moment there are only 8 different frequencies possible. At the moment
all transmitted frequencies are initialized at the beginning of the sequence.
A possible solution would be to initialize the frequencies after the sequence
was parsed and initialized only the ued frequencies. This would require a major
rewrite of the main program structure


- Simultanious pulses:

The rf_pulse may be edited to support two RF frequencies at the same time.
Alternatively an additional pulse may be used (rf_pulse_dual)
