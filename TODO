* Possible Bugs:

- Conflict handler does not check if the same TTL channel is switched
- Trigger sequence at the beginning. No edge detection
- Rounding of the DDS frequency register in relation to the FPGA

* Missing features - Not that important

- Add an interactive include tester
- Logging to files
- DDS sweeps
- Shape handling in the DDS RAM.
- Error handling
- Stack for subroutines (in VHDL ???)
- QFP variable type handling (bool, int)
- More than 7 transitions in one sequence

* Missing unitttests

- Simultanious RF pulses
- DIO confiuration
- Line Trigger
- Cycle Count
- Trigger for QFP
- Configuration for PCP internals
- DDS switching off
- Conflict handling
- Pulse Shaping

* Missing tests on hardware

- QFP Variable handling
- Amplitude calibration
- Amplitude calibration for shapes
- finite loops (bdec,ldc)
- Inverted TTLs
- TTL subsystem
- Additional label/subroutine/loop testing
- Additional tests for the LVDS Bus
- Wait insn
- phase coherent switching
- High level functions for the DAC,DDS


* DDS Sweeps

- External Pins:
   - DRCTL
   - DROVER
   - DRHOLD

- Configuration:
   - Frequency in dedicated register
   - Digital Ramp destination bits:
      CFR2(21:20): 00 - Frequency
   - No Dwell - 1
   - Use register 0

- Sequencer2
   - Use register which is used as NULL frequency
   - Initialize register before sweeping
   - Do sweep
   - Rewrite NULL transition after sweep
