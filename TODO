* Missing features - Important:

- Line Trigger
- More than 7 transitions
- Simultanious RF pulses

* Missing features - Not that important

- Change sequence list to custom dict
- Add an interactive include tester
- Logging to files
- DDS sweeps
- Error handling
- Stack for subroutines (in VHDL ???)

* Missing unitttests

- Cycle Count
- Trigger for QFP
- Amplitude calibration
- Amplitude calibration for shapes
- DIO confiuration
- Configuration for PCP internals
- DDS switching off
- Conflict handling
- Pulse Shaping
- finite loops (bdec,ldc)

* Missing tests on hardware

- Inverted TTLs
- TTL subsystem
- Additional label/subroutine/loop testing
- Additional tests for the LVDS Bus
- Wait insn
- phase coherent switching
- High level functions for the DAC,DDS
