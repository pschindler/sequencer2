The DDS board
=============

LVDS connectors
---------------

They are used to program the DDS output from the FPGA on the main
board. Each DDS needs to have a different number on the bus. The
number set at the DIP-Switch, the red box with the 4 switches,
represents the number on the bus and is therefore important for
programming the DDS output frequency.  5V Power Supplies and 12V Power

Supply
------

These have to be connected with the 5V, or respectively the 12V, power
supply of the pulse box. The current consumption of a DDS board at
normal operation can be estimated with about 1A.

Unfortunately, the holes at too small to use standard connectors for
theses. Hence, it's the easiest thing to directly solder the wires to
the pads. But make sure that when you mount the DDS board, there is no
stress on the cable. Otherwise the cable might break after some time,
and checking each power supply of every DDS board is probably to first
thing one might do when looking for the bug.  1GHz Reference Clock

This is the input of the reference clock signal, and its frequency has
to be 1GHz. This frequency is supplied by the Clock Generator Board,
or the Clock Distributor Board respectively.  100MHz Logic Clock

This is the input clock for the logic system on the board, and its
frequency has to 100MHz. This frequency is supplied by the Clock
Generator Board, or the Clock Distributor Board respectively, too.

DDS Output
----------

This is the output connector of the generated
frequency. Unfortunately, this output is not galvanicly
isolated. Hence, in order to galvanicly isolate all pulse box outputs,
one needs to add a transformer between the DDS output and the actual
pulse box output.  

Programming the FPGA
--------------------

The FPGA on the DDS board can be programmed with two different protocols:

* JTAG - Temporary programming - Connector J1
* Active serial programming - Permanent programming - Conenctor J2

The JTAG port is used to convert the FPGA into a logic analyzer to
test the LVDS bus. The permanent program of the FPGA is programmed via
active serial programming. The firmware can be downloaded from the
project homepage:

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the DDS gives a slightly wrong frequency (e.g. 100MHz instead of
80MHz) then the reference frequency in the software is set
incorrectly.

If the DDS does not react at all, the LVDS bus needs to be investigated.
