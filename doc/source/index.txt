Welcome to the PBox documentation!
===================================

This documentation covers the PBox experimental control system that is
currently used at University of Innsbruck. The two most relevant
repositories are hosted on github. For specific documentation refer to
the README file of the corresponding repository:

The sequencer2 compiler

https://github.com/pschindler/sequencer2

The VHDL code for the DDS board

https://github.com/pschindler/vhdl-ad9910


The following gives a quick tour to the Hardware and Software options
of the various versions of the PBox.
