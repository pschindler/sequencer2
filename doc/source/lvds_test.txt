Testing the LVDS Connectors
===========================

The LVDS bus consists of two 50 pin flat ribbon cables conencting the
DDS boards with the breakout boards. Unlike the digital output board
there exists no board to test the conenctions visually with LEDs. The
LVDS bus can be tested directly with a DDS board. For this the DDS
board is connected to the breakout board. Then, a logic analyzer is
programmed into the FPGA on the DDS board.

For this, one needs to install QUARTUS II, which is a software from
Altera and a FPGA programming device USB blaster. The logic analyzer
in QUARTUS II is called SignalTap. More information about SignalTap can be found in: 

http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/qts/qts_qii53009.pdf

The SignalTap file is ``test_lvds_bus.stp``. In order to download the
logic analyzer into the FPGA, the USB blaster needs to be connected to
the JTAG port on the DDS board (labelled J1). The correct JTAG file is
``dds_controller_stp_test_lvds_bus.sof``

Now the test ``Test LVDS bus (Logic analyser)`` should be performed (see :doc:`testing_hardware`).

After applying the test, the state of the bus should be
``0xaaaaaaaa``. So all lines of the bus should be alternating
high/low.

With the next test, the timing of the bus can be investigated. The
SignalTap should cycle between the value ``0xfffffffe`` and
``0x00000000``. The delay between two cycles hould be roughly 15 clock
cycles.

If these tests are performed succesfully, the DDS board should work
immediately after applying the 1GHz clock.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Most common hardware errors are:

* The terminators of the LVDS bus are not isntalled
* The connector between the mainboard and the breakout board is incorrectly 
  soldered.
* The connectors of the flat ribbon cable are not properly attached.
* The clock of the DDS board is not connected
* The LVDS-TTL converters on the DDS board are incorrectly soldered.
