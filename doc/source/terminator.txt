LVDS Terminators
================

General description
-------------------

LVDS is a bus where a current flows. So, if there is no terminator
with a resistor, the right amount of current can't flow. Hence, a
terminator is mandatory.

The best thing is to connect one side of the cable with the source,
e.g. the break-out board, and the other side with the terminator. In
between, the DDS boards can be connected to the cable.  

Building a terminator
---------------------

First, one needs to order the PCB at a manufacturer. REMEMBER ONE
NEEDS TWO TERMINATORS FOR ONE PULSE BOX! The required PCB file can be
found in the folder \\anna-c704\calcium40\ControlPrograms\PBox
documents\lvds-terminator and is called lvds-terminator.PcbDoc. For
each PCB, one needs two resistor arrays. The RS-Components order
number can be found in the same folder in the file
resistor_order.txt. Additionally, one needs a 50-pin-connector for
each PCB, too.

When soldering the orientation of the resistors is not import, but the
orientation of the 50-pin-connector is important!!! The first pin on
the PCB (the only squared pin) has to be on the same side as the
single slit (in the middle) of 50-pin-connector.
