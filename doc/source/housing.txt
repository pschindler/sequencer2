Housing for the Box
===================

The SolidWorks files can be found under \\Anna-c704\sqip\Pulse
Box\SolidWorks. With these files, one can order anywhere. The cheapest
company (by much) so far was EGU Metall. Their quote can be found
under \\Anna-c704\sqip\Pulse Box\SolidWorks\Quote.  Since the inputs
and outputs have to be galvanically isolated and there are isolating
SMA connectors, one has to use a non-conducting material for the front
panel. For example, one can order 6mm POM (plastic) at "Technische
Kunststoffe" and the guys from the mechanical workshop will mill it.
Some additional things have to be ordered as well.

    Handles: RS-Components part number 667-0365 Network cable
    connector for front panel: RS-Components part number 186-3149
    Power supply: RS-Components part number 177-804 Fans: if desired,
    any 12cm fan will do


Description
-----------

The main board and the break-out board are mounted above the frequency
generator to save room in the case. Up to 10 DDS boards could be
mounted in the back (but only 9 connector holes in tqhe panel). The
frequency distributors can be mounted in the front or in the back. If
additional PCBs have the same size as the frequency distributor (100mm
x 70mm), they can be mounted too.
