= Documentation for the sequencer2 PPG compiler =

== Overview ==

This doucment is meant to be the manual for the sequencer2 server once it grows up.

This document is written in the ASCIIDOC markup language. You can easily generate a 
pdf or html version of this file. or more information see:

link:[http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/]

=== About the sequencer2 ===

The sequencer2 is a compiler for the FPGA experiment control system known as the
Programmable pulse generator (PPG).

The home page of the PPG is at:

link:[http://pulse-programmer.org]

=== Structural overview ===

The sequencer2 source code consists of two different modules:

[grid="all"]
`-----------------`----------------------------------------------
sequencer2         The Bytecode assembler
server             A TCP server for interfacing with LabView
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Where the sequencer2 module generates the binary code for the PPG and transmits

it via an ehternet connection.

Te sequencer2 module can be used without the server module

The server package is a high level interface for the sequencer module and handles

the communication with the experiment control software. 

== Installing the software ==

For installing the server the Python programming language in
version 2.4 to 2.6 is required.

*The  sequencer2 does not work with python 3.0 or higher*

The python programming language can be downloaded at:
link:http://python.org[http://python.org]

The sequencer2 itself does not need an installation. Just copy to files to a directory and run the server from a command line.

== Configuring the server ==

The default configration is stored in the file config/sequencer2.ini. Do not edit his file.

The site configuration is stored in the file user_sequencer2.ini.

To generate this file run the interactive script configure.py:

....................
python configure.py
....................

This script will generate the file config/user_sequencer2.ini

For a new setup make sure that at least following settings are correct:

[grid="all"]
.-----------------------------.----------------------------------
Setting                         Value
-----------------------------------------------------------------
box_ip_address                  The network address of the sequencer.
DIO_configuration_file          Your hardware configuration file
sequence_dir                    The directory of your sequence files
include_dir                     The directory of your include files
nonet                           False
reference_frequency             Your DDS reference frequency
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The network address of the sequencer is set by the DIP switches on the sequencer PCB board

=== How to set up the ip address ===

To set the ip address on the PPG main board use the red dip switches.

The pin usage on the board is:

.............................
|reset|ip1|ip2|ip3|ip4|dhcp|
.............................

set dhcp to OFF

The ip address is 192.168.0.X where

............................................
X = 220 + ip1 + 2 * ip2 + 4 * ip3 + 8 * ip4
............................................

=== Starting up the server ===

After that the server may be started with:

.................................
 python test_sequencer2_server.py
.................................

=== Configuring the logging module ===

Generally the logging module is set in the startup file.
For a default installation this file is test_sequencer2_server.py

The logging is enabled by the line

..........................................
logger=ptplog.ptplog()
..........................................

The log level is determined by the configuration file user_sequencer2.ini.

Following options are allowed:

............................
log_filename = None
console_log_level = WARNING
combined_log_level = DEBUG
default_log_level = DEBUG
............................

If log_filename is set to None, the sequencer logs only to the terminal
with default_log_level

Following log levels are allowed:

.......
DEBUG
INFO
WARNING
ERROR
.......

=== Logging to files ===

The logging facilites are also able to log to a couple of files.
To log to files the logger should be configured as:

..............................
log_filename = log/sequencer2
..............................

Now the logger will log to following files:
.........................
sequencer2_sequencer2.log
sequencer2_api.log
sequencer2_server.log
sequencer2_DACcontrol.log
sequencer2_all.log
..........................

The file sequencer_all.log will contain messages from all different logging parts with the log level set by
combined_log_level

=== Viewing log files ===

The log files which are describd may be viewed with the help of the logtools
The logtools are included in any sequencer2 distribution and may be invoked typing

........................
python debug/logtools.py
........................

== Writing pulse sequences ==

There are 2 possibilities of generating pulse sequences:

- Generate a pulse sequence directly from sequencer2
- Use the server and high level script files to generate pulse sequences

=== Writing pulse sequences directly in the sequencer2 ===

A typical pulse sequence:

...............................................
import sequencer
import api
import ptplog
my_sequencer=sequencer.sequencer()
my_api=api.api(my_sequencer)
my_api.dac_value(1, 12)
my_api.jump("test")
my_sequencer.compile_sequence()
...............................................

This script is then directly executed in the sequencer2 root directory by typing:

An example is 

....................
python [script_name]
....................

==== List of API commands ====

Below is a table of commands which are available through the API interface

[grid="all"]
.-------------------------------------.---------------------------------------
Command                                 Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------
wait(time, use_cycles=False)		wait for a given time in Microseconds
label(label_name)			Insert a label 
jump(target_name)			Jump to label with given name
jump_trigger(target_name,trigger)	Jump to label if trigger inputs match the Bitmask
start_finite(label_name, loop_count)	Begin a finite loop with given loop count
end_finite(target_name)	 		End a finite loop
begin_subroutine(sub_name)		Start a subroutine
end_subroutine(sub_name)		End a subroutine
call_subroutine(sub_name)		Calls a subroutine
ttl_value(value, select)		Sets the status of a 16Bit part of the digital IO
dac_value(value, address)		Sets the DAC on the DDS board with the given address
init_dds(dds_instance)			Control the AD9910 DDS
update_dds(dds_instance)
set_dds_profile(dds_inst, profile)
set_dds_freq(dds_inst, freq, profile)
load_phase				Control the phase registers
pulse_phase
init_frequency
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Using the DDS from the API interface ====

A simple example for testing the functionality of the DDS board:

........................................
my_sequencer = sequencer.sequencer()
my_api = api.api(my_sequencer)
dds_device = ad9910.AD9910(my_device, 800)
my_api.init_dds(dds_device)
my_api.set_dds_freq(dds_device, frequency, 0)
my_api.set_dds_profile(dds_device, 0)
my_api.update_dds(0, dds_device)        
my_sequencer.compile_sequence()
........................................

For more examples on testing the DDS see the file

......................
tests/test_hardware.py
......................


=== Writing pulse sequences with server component ===

The server component acts as an interface between the API component and an advanced experiment control program.

A sequence is executed as follows:

- Experiment control software sends script filename and sequence data to the server
- Server interprets this "command string" and loads the sequence file
- The sequence file is executed
- The server sends data back to the experiment control software.

An example sequence file:

............................................................................
# Define the sequence variables
<VARIABLES>
det_time=self.set_variable("float","det_time",100000.000000,0.01,2e7)
</VARIABLES>
# The save form specifies which data will be saved and how, when a scan is performed.
# If this is omitted a standard form is used
<SAVE FORM>
  .dat   ;   %1.2f
  PMTcounts;   1;sum; 		(1:N);		%1.0f
</SAVE FORM>
# Here the sequence can override program parameters. Syntax follows from "Write Token to Params.vi"
<PARAMS OVERRIDE>
AcquisitionMode fluorescence
DOasTTLword 1
Cycles 1
</PARAMS OVERRIDE>
# The sequence itself
<SEQUENCE>
ttl_pulse(["397_det", "866"],det_time)
</SEQUENCE>
# Some spooky LabView stuff
<AUTHORED BY LABVIEW>
1
</AUTHORED BY LABVIEW>
............................................................................


This file contains chunk that is needed for the Innsbruck experiment control system also known as QFP ...

The format of the command string is described in the Innsbruck manual available on the sf.net download site.

== Reporting Bugs ==

If you encounter any bugs in the software/hardware your experiment write an email to:

philipp.schindler@uibk.ac.at

== Testing the sequencer2 ==

The sequencer may be tested with following command:

.................................
  python sequencer2_unittest.py
.................................

If this finishes without any error message your sequencer2 setup should work.


== More documentation ==

A general talk about the Box may be found on

link:[http://pulse-sequencer.sourceforge.net/innsbruck/obergurgl-box.pdf]

A sequence programming overview may be found on:

link:[http://pulse-sequencer.sourceforge.net/innsbruck/box-cheat.pdf]

The LabView interface documentation and a general overview may be found in
the old documentation:

link:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129764&package_id=220283[pcp-doc.pdf]

Please note that this manual refers to the "old" sequencer and is not generally
valid for the sequencer2. The LabView interface is identical in the two servers.

=== API documentation ===

The server uses the epydoc markup language inside the source code.

An (presumably) outdated snapshot is available at:

link:[http://pulse-sequencer.sf.net/innsbruck/sequencer2/]

To generate the documentation the epydoc interpreter is needed.
It is available from: link:[http://epydoc.sf.net]

The documentation is generated with the command:

............................................
  epydoc -v --top=server server sequencer2
............................................


== Debugging the sequencer ==

For debugging the API commands are used.

Simple tests are collected in the file tests/test_hardware.py

For testing purposes an interactive python shell is needed.
For better testing experince it is recommended to use the
improved python shell link:[http://ipython.scipy.org].

If python is in your system path the shell may be invoked
in a command window by simply typing

.........
python
.........

Then the test_hardware file has to be imported:

..................................
from tests.test_hardware import *
..................................

After that the HardwareTests class has to instantiated

......................
ht = HardwareTests()
......................

To test the TTL subsystem of the Box type then:

...................
ht.test_ttl_set()
...................

It is advisable to play around with the commands defined in
tests.test_hardware.py to get a feeling of how the commands
work

Tips for trouble shooting can be found in the general box documentation:

link:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129764&package_id=220283[pcp-doc.pdf]


== Debugging the server with ipython ==

This debugging method is for low level debugging of the server.
You might not need it anyway....

For debugging the server the ipython python shell is recommended.
Ipython is available at:

link:http://ipython.scipy.org[http://ipython.scipy.org]

Start the ipython shell in the root directory of the server.
Generate the necessary variables and includes by running followinf command:

........................
  %run test_ipython.py
........................

A simple sequence consisting of two ttl pulses is then generated with the commands

....................
  ttl_pulse("1",10)
  ttl_pulse("2",10)
....................

The sequence list is generated with the command

....................................................................
  user_api.final_array = user_api.get_sequence_array(sequence_var)
....................................................................

Compiling the sequence is done with the command

..............................
 user_api.compile_sequence()
..............................

The sequence is displayed with the following command:

.................................................
  user_api.sequencer.debug_sequence(force=True)
.................................................
